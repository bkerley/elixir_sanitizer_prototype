# Elixir Sanitizer Prototype

This is the code from my ElixirConf 2024 Lightning Talk,
"Behavior Sanitizers."
It's here so it doesn't get lost in a forgotten
LiveBook somewhere, but it's not production-ready.

Blog post forthcoming!

## Huge Caveat

This code is a prototype!
If you are planning to use this to prevent SQL injection attacks
in production, please reconsider!
At time of writing, this code has **never** been run in production.

## Installation

### Preferred Method

Don't. This code is a prototype and is probably not safe or useful!

### I'm Serious Tho

Clone it? 

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_sanitizer_prototype>.
